# Porfolio-Website

This is the code for my portfolio website, hopefully it can help someone else build a portfolio for themselves as well!

Note: This website isn't optimized for mobile as of now (6/27/2017), and the PHP extentions are misleading. There's really no PHP in those files, I just never changed them after working on actual PHP files for the Retro Game Store. Harmless mistake that I'll fix in the future!
